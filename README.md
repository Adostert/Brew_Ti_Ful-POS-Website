# Javascript-Project
Repo for GC Javascript Project  - Aaron, Tanita &amp; Amber

  Using JQuery, Bootstrap, JS, CSS, Sass, and HTML we created this fully functioning coffee (with a twist) website. 
Bootstap was used heavily on the landing page to create the grid of products, mobile functioning. 
Standard JS was used for making the interactive pop-up which features customizable options and adds to cart. 
In the checkout, JQuery and JS was used to have a function POS that allows the user to purchase with cash or card.
